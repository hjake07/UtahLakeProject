    <h1>Bait for Utah Lake</h1>
    <p>Bait depends on the fish so It will be seperated by best bait for fish</p>
    <h3>Bait for White bass</h3>
    <p>Worms: Usually under a bobber to keep it off the bottom<br>
    Artificial lures: Spinners and jigs do well, the best color is white and chartreuse green.<br>
        Live minnows: I have never personally but I hear it's a good technique.</p>
<br/>
    <h3>Bait for Channel Catfish</h3>
    <p>Worms: Not the best choice but always a classic.<br>
        Chicken Liver: I only catch Channel Catfish with chicken liver so it's a good choice.<br>
        Carp meat: My favorite is carp meat because I catch the largest Channels this way</p>
<br/>
    <h3>Bait for Yellow Bullhead Catfish</h3>
    <p>Worms:<br>
    Worms:br>
    Worms: This speaks for itself use worms and you will catch them</p>
<br/>
    <h3>Bait for Carp</h3>
   <p>>Bread: lots of other fish eat bread balls but it has worked for me when targeting carp<br>
    Corn: They love corn kernels as they are herbivores mainly</p>
