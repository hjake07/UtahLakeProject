<h1>Fishing Utah Lake</h1>
<p>Utah lake is a large natural lake. It is at the center of utah county, it is a very popular 
    spot for boating. It has beautiful real-estate along the shore as well. But an often overlooked 
    activity is the fishing.
</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of fish in this lake, that is why I have made this website as a 
    guide for anglers. Fish have different habits depending on their species: some prefer grass, 
    while others feel most at home in rocky outcroppings or under docks. Some like to live in the 
    shallows while others prefer the colder deep.
</p>
<h2>History of Lake</h2>
<p>The lake has a very rich history that goes hand in hand with the pioneers who settled there in the mid 1800s
some of the problems the lake has can be traced back and explained through history too.
It was said when the Mormon Pioneers settled around the lake that it was very abundant with fish. I remember reading
a story about how the lake was so full you could drag an empty hook through the water and pull in fish. The Fish
were a lifeline for the settlers. It was food that was abundant in a new land they had to till and try to farm in.
The soil is rocky and high in clay so it can be hard to farm in if it is new to you.

<h2>
The state of the Lake
</h2>
<p>
There is a reason this lake is not popular. It doesn't look all that clean, and to be honest it's not. It has 
some mercury content and a lot of silt. There are multiple tributaries that empty into the lake so it gets a large
load of mud in the spring. This is because the water comes from winter snow that melts in many of the rivers which lead
into the lake. Another point is the algae blooms. It makes the lake a sickly green color around June. This also killed a Utahns
dog and it caused a bit of a stir in the local news and people have been more cautious since.
</p>
<h2>Seasons</h2>
<p>There seasons and water temperature affect the behavior of the fish. Some fish are less aggresive during the colder months
    and some fish prefer to hunt when it gets dark. Overall the summer is the best time because the majority of fish are active
    during the summer. The info for each fish will be in the fish section above in the Fish "link" at the top.
